even :: Int -> Bool
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

What is the type of?

 * map 3

   map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
     3 :: Int =? (a -> b)  NO!
   Type error :-(

 * map even

   map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
     even :: Int -> Bool =? a -> b  Yes: { a = Int, b = Bool }
   map even :: [Int] -> [Bool]
